      INTERNET HALL of FAME INNOVATOR Tim Berners-Lee In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee
      invented the World Wide Web, an Internet-based hypermedia initiative for
      global information sharing while at CERN, the European Particle Physics
      Laboratory. He wrote the first web client and server in 1990. His
      specifications of URIs, HTTP and HTML were refined as web technology
      spread. He is Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a Web
      standards organization founded in 1994 that develops interoperable
      technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the
      Web to its full potential. He is a founding Director of the Web Science
      Trust (WST) launched in 2009 to promote research and education in Web
      Science, the multidisciplinary study of humanity connected by technology.
      Berners-Lee is also a Director of the World Wide Web Foundation, launched
      in 2009 to coordinate efforts to further the potential of the Web to
      benefit humanity. At MIT, Berners-Lee is the 3Com Founders Professor of
      Engineering in the School of Engineering, with a joint appointment in the
      Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the
      Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAIL). He is
      also a Professor in the Electronics and Computer Science Department at the
      University of Southampton, UK. In 2001 Berners-Lee became a Fellow of the
      Royal Society. He has been the recipient of several international awards.
      In 2004 he was knighted by H.M. Queen Elizabeth, and in 2007 he was
      awarded the Order of Merit.
